Basic plan:

generate mathematical objects and properties -> cache -> feed into the conjecture generator.

The conjecture generator gets a list of vectors of numbers and (possibly boolean) properties, to
avoid recomputing things, we store properties into csv files to load for equational generation.


we'll have the following list of py/csv files at the end:

graphs
groups
knots
numTheory
posets
topology
hypergraphs
